# Hate-Speech-Detection

The objective of this project is to predict either tweet is considered as hate speech, offensive or neither 

The result of the best performing model (SVM) gives 95% accuracy on training data and 85% on testing data. However, there seems to be imbalance dataset where the classifer perform poorly on underrepresented class. I am working to solve this issue
